#Shipping Orders Performance Analysis (Excel Pivot Dashboard)

This project focuses on analyzing a shipping orders dataset using Microsoft Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts. The objective was to convert raw order data into a structured report and dashboard to identify trends in orders, customer types, shipping modes, priorities, and regional performance.

Using Excel’s pivot-based reporting, the dataset was summarized into meaningful insights such as order distribution by state and city, customer segmentation, account manager-wise order handling, and shipping priority analysis. Visualizations were created using Pivot Charts to make the analysis easy to understand and presentation-ready.

Tools Used: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts)
