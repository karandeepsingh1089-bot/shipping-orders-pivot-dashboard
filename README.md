# Shipping Orders Performance Analysis (Excel Pivot Dashboard)
### by Karandeep

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a shipping orders dataset using **Microsoft Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts**.  
The goal was to convert raw order data into a structured report and dashboard to identify trends in **orders, customer types, shipping modes, order priorities, and regional performance**.

By using Excel pivot-based reporting, the dataset was summarized into insights such as:
- Order distribution by **State and City**
- Customer segmentation by **Customer Type**
- Orders handled by different **Account Managers**
- Order patterns across **Order Priority**
- Performance comparison across **Shipping Modes**
